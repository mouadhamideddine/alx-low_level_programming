Initialization:

Create a structure Ht_item to represent each key-value pair.
Create a structure HashTable to hold an array of pointers to items (Ht_item).
The size represents the number of buckets in the hashtable, and count represents the number of key-value pairs stored.
Creating the Hashtable:

Allocate memory for the HashTable structure.
Allocate memory for an array of pointers to Ht_item structures.
Initialize each pointer in the array to NULL.
Hash Function:

Implement a hash function that takes a key and returns an index within the array.
This index is where the key-value pair will be stored.
Inserting a Key-Value Pair:

Use the hash function to find the index for the given key.
Check if there's already an item at that index. If not, create a new Ht_item for the key-value pair and store it there.
If there is a collision (i.e., another key already exists at that index), handle it using techniques like chaining or open addressing.
Retrieving a Value:

Use the hash function to find the index for the given key.
If there's an item at that index, check if the keys match. If yes, return the associated value.
Deleting a Key-Value Pair:

Use the hash function to find the index for the given key.
If there's an item at that index, check if the keys match. If yes, delete the item.
If dealing with collisions, handle them appropriately.
Handling Collisions:

Implement a strategy for dealing with collisions (e.g., chaining, open addressing).
